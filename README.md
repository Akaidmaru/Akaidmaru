### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Reddmar Quevedo, I'm a Mechanical Engineer studying programming, I'm learning Web Development to start some projects I have on mind.

Also i'm a Pixel artist, trying to improve my art and also thinking to start with more complex drawings.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some code to get a better undestanding of Python.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on some Videogame or Software.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Programming, Pixel Art, Game Design, Mechanical Engineering and Salsa & Casino.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I know How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood! and I love to read!
